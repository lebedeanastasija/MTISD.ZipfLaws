Mars

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars
carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the "Red Planet"[14][15] because the reddish iron oxide
prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked
eye.[16] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters
of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.

The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces
the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System,
and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern
hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.[17][18] Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos,
which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids,[19][20] similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.

There are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability potential of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant
life. Future astrobiology missions are planned, including the Mars 2020 and ExoMars rovers.[21][22][23][24] Liquid water
cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the Earth's,[25] except at
the lowest elevations for short periods.[26][27] The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.[28][29] The
volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a
depth of 11 meters (36 ft).[30] In November 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia
Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake
Superior.[31][32][33]

Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude reaches −2.94,
[12] which is surpassed only by Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. Optical ground-based telescopes are typically
limited to resolving features about 300 kilometers (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's
atmosphere.[34]

Mars is approximately half the diameter of Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's
dry land.[8] Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in
about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide,
or rust.[35] It can look like butterscotch;[36] other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish,
depending on the minerals present.[36]

Internal structure
Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials.[37] Current models of
its interior imply a core with a radius of about 1,794 ± 65 kilometers (1,115 ± 40 mi), consisting primarily of iron and
nickel with about 16–17% sulfur.[38] This iron(II) sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in lighter elements as
Earth's.[39] The core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the
planet, but it appears to be dormant. Besides silicon and oxygen, the most abundant elements in the Martian crust are
iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 km (31 mi),
with a maximum thickness of 125 km (78 mi).[39] Earth's crust averages 40 km (25 mi).

Mars is a terrestrial planet that consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that
typically make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt,[40] although parts are more
silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo
suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal
concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of
high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found.[41] Much of the surface is
deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.[42][43]
Although Mars has no evidence of a structured global magnetic field,[45] observations show that parts of the planet's
crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past.
This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors.
One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these
bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and
the planet's magnetic field faded.[46]

It is thought that, during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created as the result of a stochastic process of
run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical
features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine,
phosphorus, and sulphur, are much more common on Mars than Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young
Sun's energetic solar wind.[47]

After the formation of the planets, all were subjected to the so-called "Late Heavy Bombardment". About 60% of the
surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era,[48][49][50] whereas much of the remaining surface is probably
underlain by immense impact basins caused by those events. There is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the northern
hemisphere of Mars, spanning 10,600 by 8,500 km (6,600 by 5,300 mi), or roughly four times the size of the Moon's South
Pole – Aitken basin, the largest impact basin yet discovered.[17][18] This theory suggests that Mars was struck by a
Pluto-sized body about four billion years ago. The event, thought to be the cause of the Martian hemispheric dichotomy,
created the smooth Borealis basin that covers 40% of the planet.[51][52]


Artist's impression of how Mars may have looked four billion years ago[53]
The geological history of Mars can be split into many periods, but the following are the three primary periods:[54][55]

Noachian period (named after Noachis Terra): Formation of the oldest extant surfaces of Mars, 4.5 to 3.5 billion years
ago. Noachian age surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters. The Tharsis bulge, a volcanic upland, is thought to
have formed during this period, with extensive flooding by liquid water late in the period. Hesperian period (named after
 Hesperia Planum): 3.5 to between 3.3 and 2.9 billion years ago. The Hesperian period is
marked by the formation of extensive lava plains. Amazonian period (named after Amazonis Planitia): between 3.3 and 2.9
billion years ago to the present. Amazonian regions
have few meteorite impact craters, but are otherwise quite varied. Olympus Mons formed during this period, with lava flows
elsewhere on Mars.

Geological activity is still taking place on Mars. The Athabasca Valles is home to sheet-like lava flows created about 200
Mya. Water flows in the grabens called the Cerberus Fossae occurred less than 20 Mya, indicating equally recent volcanic
intrusions.[56] On February 19, 2008, images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed evidence of an avalanche from a
700-metre-high (2,300 ft) cliff.[57]
